```json
 "scripts": {
       * "test": "nodemon -x \"mix test\" -d . -e ex,exs",
       * "start": "mix phx.server",
       * "build": "webpack",
       * "clean": "bsb -clean-world",
       * "build:bs": "bsb -make-world",
       * "watch": "BS_WATCH_CLEAR=true bsb -make-world -w"
    }
```

* The program expects to provide a token in the browser. Need to figure that out. *


Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
